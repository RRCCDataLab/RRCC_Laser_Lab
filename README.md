## Welcome to the RRCC Laser GitHub Page. Below you will find links and information for the attached repo.

**Background Information** : Over the fall of 2017 the students of Red Rocks Community College designed and build an 80 watt computer controlled laser cutter. The process took around 12 weeks working 4 to 8 hours a week. The parts were ordered from:

* Gantry parts: https://openbuilds.com/
* Laser parts: http://www.lightobject.com/
* Building table parts: https://www.homedepot.com/
* Other: https://www.amazon.com/

***

The parts list can be found here: [Parts List](https://github.com/RedRocksCommunityCollege/RRCC_Laser_Lab/tree/master/Parts%20List). We have included both an Excel and .csv file for both the gantry and laser parts list. 

The image files can be found here: [Laser build pictures](https://github.com/RedRocksCommunityCollege/RRCC_Laser_Lab/tree/master/Laser_Build_Pictures). The images have a basic description in the file name. They are in chronological order and images that have a measurement in it should have a close-up that follows the wide image.  

The project timeline and To Do can be found here: [Timeline and ToDo](https://github.com/RedRocksCommunityCollege/RRCC_Laser_Lab/projects/1). In the Projects tab you will find all the ongoing issues that we are working on. If you would like to work on one of these isseus feel free to assign the issue to yourself and move it the the active column. Once you are finished please move the issue to the Done column and mark the issue as closed in the issues tab. We are using the following code for issues:

* **Bug** is software related issue (Eg make a wiki, Work on GitHub, add files...)
* **Enhancement** is for physical modifications to the Laser cutter.
* **Question** is for elements that need leadership approval.

The tube that we are using is a [W2 Reci laser tube](http://www.recilaser.com/en/index.php?m=&c=Index&a=show&catid=7&id=66) that has a wattage of 90.
