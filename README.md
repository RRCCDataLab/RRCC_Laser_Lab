## Welcome to the RRCC Laser GitHub Page. Below you will find links and information for the attached repo.

**Background Information** : Over the fall of 2017 the students of Red Rocks Community College designed and build an 80 watt computer controlled laser cutter. The process took around 12 weeks working 4 to 8 hours a week. The parts were ordered from:

* https://openbuilds.com/
* http://www.lightobject.com/
* https://www.homedepot.com/
* https://www.amazon.com/

The parts list can be found here: [Parts List](https://github.com/RedRocksCommunityCollege/RRCC_Laser_Lab/tree/master/Parts%20List). We have included both an Excel and .csv file for both the gantry and laser parts list. 

The image files can be found here: [Laser build pictures](https://github.com/RedRocksCommunityCollege/RRCC_Laser_Lab/tree/master/Laser%20Build%20Pictures/Laser%20Build). The images have a basic description in the file name.
